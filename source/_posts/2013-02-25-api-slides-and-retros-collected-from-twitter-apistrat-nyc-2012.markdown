I had a blast at the API Strategy and Practices Conference in NYC over the weekend. I learned things, I shared and socialized ideas, and was generally awed by the level of brainshare happening. In an effort to share this with folks who didn't make it, I've collected all I could along the way, and I'm sharing it.

Please send me anything I've missed, whether you presented it or just took better notes than me.
