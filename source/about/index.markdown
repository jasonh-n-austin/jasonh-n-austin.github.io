My name is Jason Harmon, I'm the API Architect for uShip.com. I've worked in software in Austin for the last 13 years, with over 17 years in the tech industry. I've worked for a wide variety of companies, from the smallest startups (this is my 4th), to the biggest companies in the tech industry. My passion for the last few years has been to focus on SOA architectures. While most of my experience has been within the enterprise realm, I've been expanding my horizons with uShip in working through the growing pains of building out a Web API optimized for all varieties of clients.

I've made a career primarily in .NET, but I've done my time in Java as well. On the side I've always worked on side projects in a wide variety of languages and tools, such as PHP and Python. I've developed a mobile application in Android/Java called BookSwapDroid, which has carved out a decent spot in the niche world of paperback book trading.

That tips the hat to my reading tendencies. I enjoy reading lots of old scifi, spy fiction & biographies, and topical looks at anything physics or space related. I've become primarily an e-reader (my Nexus 7 is getting that job done lately), but I often can't escape dusty old paperbacks for the occasional out-of-print indulgence.

I'm looking forward to sharing my observations on growing a pragmatically RESTful platform, patterns utilized, as well as the inclusion of BDD testing principles along the way.
