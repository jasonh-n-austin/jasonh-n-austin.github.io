      <p>2014 was an extremely busy year at Paypal: heading up the API Design team, in an effort to API-ify over 80% of the company&rsquo;s capabilities. I only managed to get out three blog posts, all on <a href="http://apiux.com/author/jasonharmon/">http://APIUX.com</a>. As I looked at revising my strategy for sharing with the community for 2015, I had to reflect on 2014.</p>

<ul>
<li>Public speaking: I attended 12 events, I think 10 of which I gave talks at. 90% of them required travel.</li>
<li>Work travel: I underestimated the amount of travel that my role at Paypal would entail. I visited San Jose on average every 6 weeks, Scottsdale 1x, Chicago 1x and even India/Bangalore for a week.</li>
<li>Meetups: as part of the events I visited, some were meetups. While I really enjoyed it, the meetup I love most, <a href="http://austinapi.com">Austin API</a> was the one I visited the least. I also contributed very little to organizing, which I feel put an unfair burden on my co-organizers.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Unfinished business</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing all year. My Evernote has quite a few stubs for blog posts (usually written on planes with no wifi) that never seem to get to a point I feel comfortable posting. My brain gets cleared up by writing down all the lessons I learn in reviewing hundreds of REST API designs. However, I wanted to be able to provide more context to some of the content, as some of it is somewhat critical in nature. In essence, I&rsquo;ve collected lots of common mistakes and basics for folks who might not know much about APIs in general.</p>

<h3>Seeds of inspiration</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with our technical trainers at Paypal on building a video series teaching API design principles, and helping guide our developers through our standards and guidance. While I felt at ease on camera, I realized how different the experience was from writing. I felt inspired to learn as much as I could about the video production and writing process.</p>

<p>I spent the holidays getting my personal life in order (namely home projects), as I realized I hadn&rsquo;t been present for more than a few weeks all year (usually catching up on short-term needs). As part of cleaning up the wreckage of the post-travel dump zone known as my home office, I thought more about sharing with the API community again.</p>

<p>I got a new webcam as a Christmas gift, based on a mention to a family member that I&rsquo;d thought about using video as a way to better communicate these concepts. Now that I had a clean office space, I started experimenting. By the end of my two weeks off, I had built a low grade production studio. I also eBay&rsquo;d off a bunch of old gadgets while cleaning up the office, enough to fund the purchase of a decent camera, microphones and lighting.</p>

<h3>Staying home</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve turned down quite a few speaking events for this year. I&rsquo;m cutting back to events where I know I&rsquo;ll be in the best environment for what I&rsquo;m passionate about. Additionally, I&rsquo;m hoping for a year at Paypal where things are more stable, and travel won&rsquo;t be such a big requirement.</p>

<p>After visiting non-stop conferences the last few years, I have a new perspective. While we&rsquo;re finding audiences and meeting people in person (and visiting with other conference traveling friends), there&rsquo;s nothing going on in between conferences. It&rsquo;s a very time consuming proposition to attend all the API conferences, as there&rsquo;s bene such a proliferation in the last year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also re-committed myself to making the Austin API Meetup a top priority. The Austin startup and tech scene in general is exploding, and there&rsquo;s so many people to share with and learn from. We&rsquo;ve made it two years, organizing top notch speakers every month&hellip;I&rsquo;m not aware of any other API meetup in the country that&rsquo;s maintained that pace. I want us to continue to strengthen the community, and I hope it leads to bigger events coming to Austin focused on APIs. I need to be home to help make all this happen.</p>

<p>It sort of clicked to me that broadcasting video is a way I can be home for my family more, and still stay connected with the API community that I love spending time with.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>My kids are nuts about Youtube. As I&rsquo;ve leared more about it from them, I find myself spending most of my time on Youtube shows, and almost zero no TV. I&rsquo;ve also discovered that modern youth culture is not focused around reading, and moreso on video learning.</p>

<p>For better or worse, I&rsquo;ve come to believe there are a younger generation of developers who want to learn from video, and really don&rsquo;t have the capacity to read 1000 words to learn something. I love mentoring new developers, and helping guide them to learn about the cutting edge, and video started to feel like a way I could broadcast that connection.</p>

<h3>Video is hard</h3>

<p>Editing a sentence in blogs is easy, when you change your mind later. With video, that often means reshooting a segment, editing and re-rending an entire episode. I&rsquo;m learning a lot, and it&rsquo;s forcing me to boil down topics more succinctly. I&rsquo;ve also had to learn how to speak to a camera, instead of a crowd.</p>

<h3>A new chapter</h3>

<p>I launched a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">Youtube channel</a> yesterday, titled &ldquo;API Workshop&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m hoping to engage a different-minded aspect of the API community. Video learning oriented, perhaps younger, and hopefully thirsty for knowledge.</p>

<p>My biggest backlog of unfinished posts is on common API design mistakes, which a friend helped me label <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmi7Sd1Nw3uljsMw9WE2lXE42cdZ0nEsH">&ldquo;Not Good APIs&rdquo;</a> (I laughed for days after he suggested it). As such, the first video is part of this series, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBXsmSrKE8&amp;list=TLUxDYVMx3C_s">&ldquo;REST API Design: Avoid future proofing with the JSON junk drawer&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>The community response has been amazing, including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eib2IXVEq-E">video reply</a> from my friend Kin Lane, &ldquo;The API Evangelist&rdquo;. The fact that he and I were able to discuss important design concepts, and the future of APIs.json in the public space was really exciting for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still hoping to get some writing done this year, but it&rsquo;s probably going to take me some time to get fast at my production process for video. Until then, see you on Youtube!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the first episode from the channel, enjoy!</p>
